# Simple ToDo List made with React and Redux üì≥
_‚Äº IMPORTANT ‚Äº This project tries to be a small application just to understand how redux works with react using reducers, accessing the redux centralized store and implementing all of this with React._

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

## Starting üöÄ

_If you want to use the repository you can clone it and use "npm install" or "yarn install"._

_I recommend use React developer tools:_ <Br />
  -[React Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=es)
 
_And Redux DevTools, a very powerful devkit which is similar to react deveoloper tools:_ <br />

### Pre-requisites üìã

_You will need:_

```
- A code editor
- A web browser
- Npm or yarn 
```
And done, you can launch the app.
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Built with üõ†Ô∏è

* [React](https://es.reactjs.org/) - Structure, styles & logic
* [Redux-Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/), [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) & [React-Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/)
* [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) - Checkbuttons

## License üìÑ

Free to use to practise and educational purpose, it is good for nothing else.
